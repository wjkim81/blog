# **From "Question Machine" to "Research Colleague"**

In September, I shared a seminar at my lab (**Biomedical Optics & Optical Metrology, KAIST**) about a topic I’ve been obsessing over for the past year: **How do we stop using AI as a toy and start using it as a serious research partner?**

We all know the frustration. You have a brilliant conversation with ChatGPT, close the tab, and the next day... it’s gone. The context is lost. You have to explain everything from scratch.

In research, where projects span months or years, this "amnesia" is fatal.

In this seminar, I broke down my transition from **Session-Based Q&A** to a **Project-Based Architecture**—a method to give AI long-term memory and deep context without needing complex coding skills.

## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered

### 1. The "Amnesia" Problem
Most researchers use AI in "Session Mode":
* **Human:** Asks question.
* **AI:** Gives answer.
* **End of Session:** Context evaporates.

This works for fixing a quick Python bug, but it fails for **Deep Research**. Complex problems (like adapting a neural field framework from microscopy to OCT) require keeping track of dozens of papers, parameters, and failed experiments.

### 2. The Solution: Project-Based Architecture
I introduced the concept of moving from *chats* to *files*.
Instead of relying on the AI's chat history, we rely on a **Structured File System** acting as an external memory.

The core of this system is the **`index.md`**:
> A single "Map File" that acts as the entry point for the AI. It contains the project goal, links to key data, and the current status.

When you start a new chat, you don't say *"Here is my project..."*
You say: *"Read `index.md` and help me with the next step in Phase 2."*

### 3. "Forensic" Workflow for Research
I explained how I treat research like a forensic investigation:
1.  **Collect Evidence:** Raw logs, papers, error messages.
2.  **Build Timeline:** Sequence events chronologically.
3.  **Detect Patterns:** Use Claude to find correlations across the timeline.
4.  **Interpret:** Only *then* do we ask for a conclusion.

### 4. Real-World Application: The OCT Project
The seminar concluded with a deep dive into my current work: adapting **Deep learning based Adaptive Optics** for **OCT imaging**.

I showed how I used a "Dual-AI" approach:
* **ChatGPT:** The "Organizer" (File structures, Python boilerplate, documentation).
* **Claude:** The "Synthesizer" (Physics reasoning, connecting papers, finding theoretical gaps).

## 🚀 Final Thought

The difference between a junior researcher and a senior researcher often isn't raw intelligence—it's **methodology**.
The same applies to AI.

The difference between getting generic advice and getting a breakthrough insight isn't the model version. It's **how you structure the information you feed it.**
