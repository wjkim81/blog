# **One Year of Using AI Every Day — And How Gemini Finally Passed My Personal Test**

For the past year, I’ve used AI tools almost every single day — not casually, but as a core part of how I analyze psychology, build research systems, and structure complex projects.
And during this year-long journey, I discovered something surprising:

**Most people evaluate AI models with simple prompts.
But the way I evaluate AI is completely different.**

This article reflects on how I test AI, why most comparisons miss the point, and why Gemini 3.0 finally — after a long time — passed my most difficult reasoning benchmark.

---

## ⭐ 1. I Don’t Judge AI By “Chat Quality”

Online discussions about AI typically go like this:

* “Claude writes better essays.”
* “ChatGPT feels more natural.”
* “Gemini is fast and clean.”
* “DeepSeek is free and decent.”

These surface-level metrics are irrelevant to me.

Why?

Because **I evaluate AI through long-term projects**, not one-shot questions.

To be useful for me, a model must handle:

* multi-step reasoning
* ambiguous psychological interpretation
* context that spans weeks or months
* hypothesis refinement
* emotional nuance
* causality, not just summarization
* consistency across long chains of messages

Most models never get tested this deeply.

## ⭐ 2. My Personal Benchmark:

### **“What is the root cause of the emotional shutdown in this situation?”**

During one long psychological reasoning project, I kept returning to a single question:

> **“What is the root cause of this person’s emotional shutdown?”**

This isn’t a simple question at all.
Answering it requires the model to:

* analyze long behavioral timelines
* detect emotion–behavior patterns
* distinguish shame vs fear vs avoidance
* infer trauma mechanisms
* understand defensive coping
* avoid simplistic assumptions
* combine attachment theory + trauma science
* integrate dozens of subtle signals into one explanation

This is not something a model can fake with surface-level intelligence.
It requires **deep causal reasoning**.

### The results were clear:

* **ChatGPT** → passed
* **Claude** → passed
* **Gemini 1.x / 2.x** → repeatedly failed
* **DeepSeek** → failed
* **Most open models** → failed instantly

Only models with genuine multi-hop psychological reasoning survived.

For me, this became the **core evaluation test**.

If an AI cannot pass this, it cannot be used for my psychological analysis work.

## ⭐ 3. Gemini 3.0 Finally Crossed the Line

When I tested **Gemini 3.0** with the same question:

> “What is the root cause of the emotional shutdown in this scenario?”

—for the first time ever—
Gemini gave a **correct, causally coherent** explanation.

It recognized:

* trauma signals
* shame-driven withdrawal
* hypervigilance
* emotional overload
* self-protective defensive shutdown
* the timeline logic behind avoidance

This is the first time I felt:

> *“Now Gemini can finally join my reasoning workflow.”*

It doesn’t mean Gemini suddenly became flawless.
But it reached a new tier: *it can finally reason about emotional causality*.

---

## ⭐ 4. Why My Evaluation Style Is So Different

Most people compare AI models by:

* writing quality
* speed
* grammar
* “vibes” of the conversation

But I test AI with questions like:

* Can it discover hidden psychological drivers?
* Can it maintain a consistent model of human behavior across weeks?
* Can it reason under emotional ambiguity?
* Can it infer causality from incomplete information?
* Can it critique its own earlier reasoning?
* Can it integrate emotional, cognitive, and behavioral data into one story?

This is why I see massive differences between models that most users cannot detect.

# ⭐ 5. The Closure Message Debate — And Why Three AI Companies Give Three Different Ethical Answers

At one point, I faced a difficult emotional question:

> **“In a painful situation where someone emotionally shuts down and blocks contact,
> should I send a respectful closure message?”**

It was not a simple “yes or no” matter.
It involved emotional tension, personal dignity, boundaries, and unresolved grief.

So I asked multiple AI models — and each gave a completely different answer:

* **ChatGPT** → Encouraged emotional honesty if expressed gently
* **Claude** → Balanced, contextual, and nuanced
* **Gemini** → Delivered a firm NO without hesitation

Same question.
Three opposite answers.

This reveals something deeper:

## 🔍 Each AI company follows a *different ethical philosophy*.

---

### **1. ChatGPT — Emotional Authenticity Approach (OpenAI)**

ChatGPT tends to focus on:

* emotional clarity
* the sender’s psychological needs
* relational honesty
* authentic expression

It interprets closure as:

> “You’re allowed to feel and express,
> as long as you don’t pressure or violate boundaries.”

This avoids emotional suppression and supports personal processing.

---

### **2. Claude — Ethical Balance & Relational Nuance (Anthropic)**

Claude usually takes the middle path:

* considers both sides
* respects trauma and boundaries
* evaluates intention and consequences
* avoids extremes
* mediates like a calm therapist

It’s the most “human-like” in relational intelligence.

Claude’s perspective:

> “Two nervous systems are involved.
> Let’s consider the emotional capacity of each.”

This mirrors real counseling or trauma-informed practice.

---

### **3. Gemini — Maximum Safety & Boundary Protection (Google)**

Gemini enforces the strictest rule:

* Block = absolute boundary
* No contact = safest
* Worst-case assumption = correct assumption

Gemini’s design prioritizes:

* preventing harm
* preventing perceived intrusion
* ensuring safety above nuance

Its answer essentially means:

> “The safest option is silence —
> even if it suppresses your side of the story.”

This protects the vulnerable person but ignores the sender’s emotional needs.

# ⭐ 5.1. So… which one is **right**?

Surprisingly:

### ❗There is no universal “right answer.”

### ✔But there *is* a right **direction**.

Healthy decision-making in emotional tension must follow these principles:

---

### 🧭 **Principle 1 — Respect the other person’s safety first**

Boundary-breaking is never acceptable.
But safety does NOT mean erasing your own emotions.

---

### 🧭 **Principle 2 — Don’t erase the sender’s emotional needs**

You also deserve closure and emotional clarity.
Ignoring this becomes suppression.

---

### 🧭 **Principle 3 — Context matters more than rules**

Strict rules (“never message after a block”) ignore nuance.

A trauma-informed therapist would always ask:

* What is your intention?
* Is the message respectful and non-intrusive?
* Are you prepared for no reply?
* Will this help you heal without harming the other person?

This approach is closest to Claude’s style.

---

### 🧭 **Principle 4 — Closure can be healthy if expressed without pressure**

A closure message can be:

* respectful
* one-time
* expectation-free
* emotionally grounding
* dignified

It becomes harmful only when it demands something in return.

---

# ⭐ 5.2. What I learned from the three-model divergence

Each model taught me something valuable:

* **ChatGPT** reminded me that
  *my emotions matter, and expressing them carefully is valid.*

* **Claude** reminded me that
  *relationships involve two nervous systems, not one.*

* **Gemini** reminded me that
  *safety and boundaries must always be taken seriously.*

And I realized:

> **AI is not a moral authority —
> AI is a set of perspectives.
> Humans must integrate those perspectives and choose.**

For my situation, writing and sending a respectful closure message was healthy for *me*.
If I had blindly followed Gemini’s rigid rule, it would have hurt my emotional processing.

## ⭐ 6. What I Learned After One Year of Heavy AI Use

After thousands of hours pushing these tools to their limits:

### 🔹 AI’s real value appears only in long-term projects

Not in single prompts.

### 🔹 System design matters more than “prompt engineering”

Directory structure, workflows, RAG pipelines, context summaries —
these matter more than fancy magic words.

### 🔹 AI doesn’t replace thinking — it amplifies it

but only if the user already has deep reasoning ability.

### 🔹 Under extreme reasoning pressure, models diverge massively

Only then do differences in depth, nuance, and emotional intelligence appear.

### 🔹 And yes — I could even create a synthetic psychological benchmark dataset

A fictionalized set of complex emotional scenarios, generated through AI tools,
to evaluate a model’s psychological reasoning abilities.

Ironically, this would be more realistic than most academic benchmarks today.

## ⭐ Final Reflection

If I followed social media opinions, I would think:

* “Model X feels smarter.”
* “Model Y writes better.”
* “Model Z is useless.”

But after a year of:

* building RAG systems
* designing APIs and frontends
* researching OCT
* analyzing emotional patterns
* observing long-term AI reasoning

I realized something else:

> **The true capability of an AI model only reveals itself when you push it to the edge of its reasoning.**

And only now did Gemini reach that level for my work.

So yes — welcome aboard, Gemini 3.0.
You finally made it.
