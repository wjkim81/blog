Wonjin Kim is a **T-shaped AI researcher and engineer** specializing in **physics-informed deep learning, computational optics (OCT/CT), and LLM-based system design**. His work bridges fundamental research and production engineering, with a focus on building **research-to-production (R2P) AI systems** that integrate medical imaging models, backend APIs, and LLM/RAG pipelines.

He is currently an **AI Researcher at Nova Science**, and concurrently a **PhD Candidate (ABD)** at KAIST.  
This dual role is enabled by a strategic R&D collaboration between Nova Science and KAIST, allowing his research in computational imaging to directly inform the development of next-generation OCT/film technologies and commercial AI-assisted imaging products.

Previously, he conducted advanced medical imaging research at the Ewha AIBI Lab, served as a Technical Lead in healthcare platform development, and gained foundational experience in **enterprise-grade system stability** through his work with DB2 mission-critical systems at **IBM Korea**.

Wonjin has authored peer-reviewed papers, holds multiple patents in AI-powered medical imaging, and designs AI systems that unify theoretical rigor with real-world deployment. His personal blog documents work across AI research, imaging systems, and long-form conceptual synthesis using LLM reasoning tools.
